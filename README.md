# Project: React + Vite

The **ToDo List App** is a simple, user-friendly task management application that allows users to create, update, and track their tasks. Built with React, it offers key features like:

- **Task Management**: Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.
- **Local Storage**: The app saves the tasks in the browser's local storage, ensuring data persists even after the page is refreshed.
- **Dark Mode**: Users can toggle between dark and light modes for a personalized experience.
- **Task Status**: Tasks can be marked as "Done" individually, or users can mark all tasks as done at once.
- **Modern UI**: The app has an intuitive and clean interface, with buttons to manage tasks and toggle between dark/light modes.
- **Responsiveness**: It is designed to work across different devices, providing a seamless user experience.

The app is ideal for anyone looking to stay organized and manage their daily tasks efficiently.

**I will promptly update the deployment link for the web application shortly.** ðŸš€
